# Using `LangChain` and `RAG` to create LLM agents to fill out an OASIS form.

An [OASIS form](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/oasis-e1-all-item-508.pdf) is filled out by a provider who follows a strict [manual](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/oasis-e1-manualfinal12-9-2024.pdf-0). Obviously most nurses don't necessarily follow the manual, but this is the most business logic we have.

- `agents` : typically contains agent definations for a RNN application;
- `engine` : provides a suit of machine learning analytic functions to perform model training and analytics on your dataset without giving up end-to-end performance
- `models` : typically contains model definations.
